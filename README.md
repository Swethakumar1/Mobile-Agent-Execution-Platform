# Mobile-Agent-Execution-Platform
This project implements a mobile-agent execution platform that is in general facilitated with three
distributed-computing technologies: RPC, dynamic linking, and object serialization/deserialization.These technologies are implmented in Java, which correspond to RMI, class loader and reflection, and
Java object input/output streams.
